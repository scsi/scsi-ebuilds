Weblogic starts slow

I had a lot of troubles starting Oracle Weblogic 10.3g under linux (CentOS
5.2). It took anywhere between 5 to 20 minutes from the time I ran startup
script to the point when Weblogic actually started. Here is typical log:

<Mar 12, 2009 12:35:34 PM EDT> <Info> <Management> <BEA-141107> <Version:
WebLogic Server 10.3  Fri Jul 25 16:30:05 EDT 2008 1137967 >
<Mar 12, 2009 12:46:37 PM EDT> <Notice> <WebLogicServer> <BEA-000365> <Server
state changed to STARTING>

Turns out Weblogic uses random number generator during start up. Because of
the bug in java it reads ¡¥randomness¡¦ from /dev/random. /dev/random is very
good random numbers generators but it is extremely slow. It takes sometimes 10
minutes or more to generate one number. /dev/urandom is not that good, but it
is instant.
Java somehow maps /dev/urandom file to /dev/random. That¡¦s why default
settings in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security are useless.

Possible solutions:
1) Add  ¡§-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom¡¨ (/dev/urandom does not
work) to java parameters.

Worse but working solution is:
2) mv /dev/random /dev/random.ORIG ; ln /dev/urandom /dev/random

3) Best solution is to change $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security
Replace securerandom.source with

securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom

This problem does not happen under windows because it uses different
implementation of /dev/random.

It takes seconds to start weblogic server now.
